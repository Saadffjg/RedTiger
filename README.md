## Usage

Once you have installed RedTiger, you can start testing for XSS vulnerabilities. Here‚Äôs a quick guide on how to use the tool effectively:

### Basic Commands

# Generate a report after scanning
./RedTiger report --output report.txt
```

### Advanced Options

RedTiger offers several advanced options to customize your testing experience:

- **Timeout Settings**: Adjust the timeout for requests to avoid hanging scans.
  
  ```bash
  ./RedTiger scan --url https://example.com --timeout 10
  ```

- **Custom Payloads**: Use your own set of payloads for more targeted testing.
  
  ```bash
  ./RedTiger scan --url https://example.com --payloads custom_payloads.txt
  ```

- **Concurrency**: Set the number of concurrent requests to speed up the scanning process.
  
  ```bash
  ./RedTiger scan --url https://example.com --concurrency 5
  ```

### Example Scan

To run a full scan on a target website, use the following command:

```bash
./RedTiger scan --url https://example.com --endpoints /api /form --concurrency 10
```

This command will scan the specified endpoints for XSS vulnerabilities while using 10 concurrent requests.
